# final-Mern-hackathon
Please accept my late submission. I had completed my task, but unfortunately, my laptop suddenly shut down. You had extended the hackathon submission deadline until Maghrib, and later until 10 PM. However, there has been no electricity in my area(Shah Lateef Town Port Qasim) from 25/04/2025 to 29/04/2025 (a total of 5 days), and my laptop had no charge left. I sincerely request you to consider my situation and not let my entire year of hard work go to waste.
